# URUI

### _by [Wolf McNally](https://www.github.com/wolfmcnally) and [Christopher Allen](https://www.github.com/ChristopherA)_

* <img src="https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/images/logos/crypto-commons-super-simple.png" width=16 valign="bottom">&nbsp;&nbsp; ***part of the [crypto commons](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/crypto-commons/blob/master/README.md) technology family***


This framework depends on [URKit](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/URKit) and implements SwiftUI interfaces for displaying URs in (possibly animated) QR code form and scanning those same QR codes back into UR form. This framework compiles for iOS devices or Mac Catalyst. Video capture not supported under the iOS simulator.

## Usage Information

Use of this framework is demonstrated in the [URDemo](https://github.com/blockchaincommons/URDemo) app. The main types of interest are:

### Displaying URs

|   |   |   |
|:--|:--|:--|
| URDisplayState | class | Tracks state of ongoing display of (possibly multi-part) UR.
| URFragmentBar | View | Displays which fragments of a multi-part UR are currently displayed or being captured.
| URQRCode | View | Displays a (possibly animated) QR code.

### Scanning URs

|   |   |   |
|:--|:--|:--|
| URFragmentBar | View | Displays which fragments of a multi-part UR are currently displayed or being captured.
| URProgressBar | View | Displays a linear progress bar.
| URScanState | class | Tracks and reports state of ongoing capture.
| URVideo | View | Displays video preview and captures QR codes.

## Installation Instructions

### Requirements

* Swift 5.3, iOS 13 or macOS 10.15 (Big Sur), and Xcode 12.2

### Building

* Build or include like any other Swift package.

## Status - Late Alpha

**URUI** is currently under active development and in the late alpha testing phase. It should not be used for production tasks until it has had further testing and auditing.

### Discussions

The best place to talk about Blockchain Commons and its projects is in our GitHub Discussions areas.

[**Gordian Developer Community**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions). For standards and open-source developers who want to talk about interoperable wallet specifications, please use the Discussions area of the [Gordian Developer Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions). This is where you talk about Gordian specifications such as [Gordian Envelope](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/BCSwiftSecureComponents/blob/master/Docs/00-INTRODUCTION.md), [bc-shamir](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-shamir), [Sharded Secret Key Reconstruction](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-sskr), and [bc-ur](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/bc-ur) as well as the larger [Gordian Architecture](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/blob/master/Docs/Overview-Architecture.md), its [Principles](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian#gordian-principles) of independence, privacy, resilience, and openness, and its macro-architectural ideas such as functional partition (including airgapping, the original name of this community).

[**Blockchain Commons Discussions**](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community/discussions). For developers, interns, and patrons of Blockchain Commons, please use the discussions area of the [Community repo](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Community) to talk about general Blockchain Commons issues, the intern program, or topics other than those covered by the [Gordian Developer Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian-Developer-Community/discussions) or the 
[Gordian User Community](https://github.com/BlockchainCommons/Gordian/discussions).

### Other Questions & Problems

As an open-source, open-development community, Blockchain Commons does not have the resources to provide direct support of our projects. Please consider the discussions area as a locale where you might get answers to questions. Alternatively, please use this repository's [issues](./issues) feature. Unfortunately, we can not make any promises on response time.

If your company requires support to use our projects, please feel free to contact us directly about options. We may be able to offer you a contract for support from one of our contributors, or we might be able to point you to another entity who can offer the contractual support that you need.

## Responsible Disclosure

We want to keep all of our software safe for everyone. If you have discovered a security vulnerability, we appreciate your help in disclosing it to us in a responsible manner. We are unfortunately not able to offer bug bounties at this time.

We do ask that you offer us good faith and use best efforts not to leak information or harm any user, their data, or our developer community. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to fix the issue before you publish it. Do not defraud our users or us in the process of discovery. We promise not to bring legal action against researchers who point out a problem provided they do their best to follow the these guidelines.

### Reporting a Vulnerability

Please report suspected security vulnerabilities in private via email to ChristopherA@BlockchainCommons.com (do not use this email for support). Please do NOT create publicly viewable issues for suspected security vulnerabilities.

The following keys may be used to communicate sensitive information to developers:

| Name              | Fingerprint                                        |
| ----------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| Christopher Allen | FDFE 14A5 4ECB 30FC 5D22  74EF F8D3 6C91 3574 05ED |

You can import a key by running the following command with that individual’s fingerprint: `gpg --recv-keys "<fingerprint>"` Ensure that you put quotes around fingerprints that contain spaces.
